# CUDA Programming Practice

This repository is my CUDA playground.

I use it to:
- test different GPU programming concepts
- implement and experiment with CUDA kernels
- practice performance-oriented thinking with parallel code

Most folders contain small focused exercises (for example vector ops, matrix math, reductions, memory labs, and simulation-style kernels).

The goal is to build intuition for CUDA execution, memory behavior, and kernel design through hands-on examples.
